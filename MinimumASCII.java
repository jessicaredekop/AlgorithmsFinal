/**
 * -------------------Dynamic Programming Solution------------------------
 * class: PalindromicSubstrings
 * Calculate the cost of recursively(?) removing a character in each string, and adding the cost to the dp[].
 * If removing characters in either/or strings does not work, find the remaining characters and compute the cost
 * of the addition.
 * Return the minimum cost.
 *
 * Base Cases:
 * 1. If one sting is empty, return the ASCII sum of the other string.
